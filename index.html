          <p>"David and the entire Dirt Busters crew have always been outstanding.  I have used them multiple times preparing my listings to sell and each and every time they have shown up on time and done a fantastic job.  From total home cleanings to junk clean-outs to carpet cleanings to windows and everything in between, I have been nothing but satisfied with their professionalism and work."</p>

          <p>"David was very responsive and got my cleaning appointment scheduled for right away. Amanda and Anna showed up on time and did a great job! We used them for a move-out cleaning, and they did such a good job that the apartment even looked cleaner than when we first moved in! I checked around with quite a few places, and their prices were by far the best for exceptional quality work. I would highly recommend using Dirt Busters Cleaning!"</p>

          <p>"David and his crew did a wonderful job on my home.  The carpets looked wonderful and smelled great.  I am very happy and will use them again.  One area of one of my rooms had a bad area where the carpet was coming apart and they were able to clean the area without damaging the carpet more.  Great Job"</p>

          <p>"David did a fantastic job on cleaning old warn out carpet that has been in this location for up to 15 years. We had tried everything to get it clean and it wouldn't work. One call and the next day David and one of his carpet techs were on location making the carpet look better than it did when we had moved in. I will recommend Dirt Busters to anyone who asks me who they should call to get anything cleaned."</p>

          <p>"I recently moved and needed my old place cleaned out quickly. David and his staff were very professional from start to finish. I appreciated how quickly David responded to my request for a quote via Yelp. He did not waste any time quoting me a price, while other cleaning companies wanted to meet me first or view the space before quoting a price. I didn't have the time or patience for all of that. David and his staff stand by their work so if something isn't right they do no hesitate to fix it. I appreciate the professionalism and speed at which they work. They were very nice and accommodating. More than anything, I appreciate they do what they say they are going to do. That is huge for me because a cleaning company I worked with in the past would make promises and not follow through. If you are looking for quality and professionalism then this is the company for you. I will definitely be scheduling maid services for my new place with them in the future."</p>

          <p>"Wow, they did a really awesome job! I had a Birthday Party and someone threw up on our carpets because they drank too much and now the spot is completely gone and the carpet smells super fresh :D. Also the cleaner was really nice and it was only 79 for 4 Rooms (Including the Master Bedroom where the perpetrator decided to pass out on our floor). Would definitely call them again!"</p>

          <p>"David and his crew were life savers! We signed a lease on a rental house and it was a mess when we received keys, in a panic we began calling everyone and anyone we could find. David answered our panicked phone call and promptly organized a crew to meet us at the house early the next morning for a full scrub down. Leaving our new home smelling clean and feeling fresh wI think a few hours. Thanks again,  we will definitely be using your services again!"</p>
